{"name":"Articles","tagline":"Word Doc","body":"To Whom It May Concern,\r\n\r\nI am trying to get an issue resolved for an American customer in Honduras. He has purchased several items and we need the funds released so that we may buy materials and start building his order. His order consist of custom built axels. I've talked to Sheri and her supervisor Chris, in both instances I don't get calls back. I had to have David walk over to Sheri's desk in order to get a response after 2 days of leaving voicmails. \r\n\r\nWhen Sheri called me back an hour later she simply told me I needed to refund my customer. She has explained that we're taking a risk and we understand that risk, and we plan to have many more transaction similar to this one. \r\nI was forwarded to Chris since Sheri was unable to help me further.\r\n\r\nChris explained than we May be able to process this transaction after she got a hold of the customer since his contact information through Paypal was incorrect due to him being stationed in Honduras. \r\nWhen I asked for a number to reach Chris at she said she would be calling my cell Thursday morning to let me know what we could do, but I received no updates. No e-mails, No phone calls. And no number to reach her back at. Patrick Krebs (My customer) has added his internation phone number via Paypal trouble ticket.\r\n\r\nOur customer has been understanding of these issues and welcomes any contact from you. As I mentioned, he has already send a trouble ticket will his phone number on Wednesday evening after my talk to Chris. \r\n\r\nI also have several e-mails I can forward to you that show our conversations in this and previous transactions with this customer, unfortunately I have nowhere to send e-mails (e-mails are returned) and Paypal doesn't accept word documents.\r\n\r\nAlso, very important, you have put all of our funds on hold, these need to be released ASAP. Our company is Not in question as far as I've been told, only the transactions to THIS particular customer. I have NOT been happy with the way this situation has been delt with. \r\nLimiting ALL of our funds and not having a staff that can handle current call volume doesn't sound like a great business practice, it simply opens your doors to your competition. I would love to continue my business with Paypal, please help me resolve this issue with an answer. My cell number is listed below. \r\n\r\nI simply want updates and a good way to contact someone directly so I can send the information that was asked for to get this issue resolved.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
